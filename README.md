#Project Name: Sample-Optimization

Description: This was done as part of an internship I participated in while attending Southern Utah University. I collaborated with three other students on this project to produce the final results as shown here.

The purpose of this study is to identify proper site selection for pilot programs using non-random representative sampling. This involves three steps:
1. Identify the optimal representative treatment group.
2. Identify optimal control group.
3. Employ the proper lift algorithm to compare the treatment to the control group.

Our primary objective is to complete the first two steps. The existing algorithm being used to find the revenue difference between treatment and control groups will be used for step three.
